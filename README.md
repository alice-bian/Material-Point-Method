# Material Point Method

**Goal:** Code a 3D material point method solver in Taichi to simulate elastic cubes colliding.<br />
<br />

**Execution & Output**

1.) Download the taichi_mpm_3d_3jellos.py file in this submission folder. Save the file to a desired location on your computer. <br />
2.) Open Terminal. Cd into where you saved the taichi_mpm_3d_3jellos.py file, then run: <br />
python3 taichi_mpm_3d_3jellos.py <br />
Be sure to have Python 3 and Taichi downloaded on your computer. <br />
3.) Running the previous step will create a folder called render_output in your current directory. There will be a series of 240 .ply files in the render_output folder by the name of jello_000XXX.ply. <br />
4.) Open the attached Houdini file called JelloRender.hipnc. Load the 240 .ply files as a series into the Frame_Sequence node. Set a camera view and render the .ply series, then plug the resulting image sequence into a multimedia player. <br />
